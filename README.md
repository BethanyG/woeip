West Oakland Air Quality Project (WOAQ) [![TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/openoakland/woeip.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/openoakland/woeip) [![Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/openoakland/woeip/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/openoakland/woeip)
===========================================================================

West Oakland Air Quality is a project of [OpenOakland](https://www.openoakland.org/), a nonprofit that bridges technology and community for a thriving and equitable Oakland. The WOAQ team is building a cloud-based tool for managing block-by-block air quality data collected by volunteer citizen scientists. WOAQ supports the nonprofit West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project (WOEIP), who started collecting this data more than a decade ago. WOEIP is a resident led, community-based environmental justice organization dedicated to achieving healthy homes, healthy jobs and healthy neighborhoods for all who live, work, learn and play in West Oakland, California.
